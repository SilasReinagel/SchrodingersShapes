Create a modern, minimalist UI mockup for a puzzle game called "Schrödinger's Shapes" with the following specifications:

Layout:
- Clean top navigation bar containing:
  - Left: Simple text logo "Schrödinger's Shapes" in Open Sans font
  - Center: Timer showing "00:35"
  - Right: Share button icon
- Large central puzzle grid (3x3)
  - Mix of "?" cells (showing subtle swirling gradients) and geometric shapes
  - Shapes are outlined with 1-2px strokes and filled with soft pastels:
    - Square in #AECBFA (pastel blue)
    - Circle in #F9CADA (pastel pink) 
    - Triangle in #FFF2AF (pastel yellow)
- Right sidebar showing puzzle constraints in clean bullet points
- Bottom status bar with move counter and undo button

Style:
- Background: Very light gray (#F9FAFB)
- Thin grid lines in medium gray
- Generous whitespace around all elements
- Subtle hover effects with teal highlight (#32C8C0)
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Minimal shadows and depth
- Responsive layout that adapts gracefully to mobile

The overall aesthetic should feel modern, airy and slightly playful while maintaining a minimalist sophistication. The design should emphasize the puzzle mechanics while being visually appealing enough to encourage social sharing.
