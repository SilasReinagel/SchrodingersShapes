# Composer Analysis v5: Schrödinger's Shapes Soundtrack

## The Problem with v4

The v4 composer selection (Arnalds, Frahm, C418, Wintory, Sakamoto) created music that was:
- ✅ Calm and focus-friendly
- ✅ Minimalist
- ❌ **Not scientific/laboratory**
- ❌ **Not futuristic**
- ❌ **Not quantum-feeling**
- ❌ **Too cozy/warm**

Schrödinger's Shapes is a **quantum physics puzzle game**. The music needs to evoke:
- Laboratory environments
- Scientific experimentation
- Futuristic technology
- Quantum uncertainty and superposition
- Intellectual curiosity about the unknown

It should NOT sound like a meditation app or lo-fi study playlist.

## What "Quantum/Scientific/Futuristic" Actually Sounds Like

### Sonic Elements That Evoke Science/Labs:
- **Analog synthesizer oscillations** (waveforms, frequency modulation)
- **Digital artifacts and glitches** (data, computation)
- **Clinical precision** (quantized, exact)
- **Spectral processing** (overtones, resonance)
- **Pulsing rhythms** (heartbeat monitors, data streams)
- **Cold digital spaces** with occasional warmth
- **Uncertainty in sound** (pitch bending, detuning, probability)
- **Particle-like textures** (granular, scattered)

### Sonic Elements That Evoke Quantum Specifically:
- **Superposition**: Multiple tones existing simultaneously, unresolved
- **Uncertainty**: Pitch that wavers, rhythms that aren't quite locked
- **Observation/Collapse**: Sounds that resolve when "observed" (triggered)
- **Entanglement**: Two voices that move together impossibly
- **Wave/Particle**: Textures that shift between smooth waves and discrete particles
