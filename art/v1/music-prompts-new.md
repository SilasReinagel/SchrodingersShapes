## Implementation Notes

### Thematic Coherence
All tracks should share the same core melodic material (the "main theme"), presented in different arrangements and complexities. This creates musical continuity across the game while allowing tracks to match puzzle difficulty.

### Difficulty Mapping
- **Easy Puzzles**: Tracks 1, 4 (minimal arrangements, clear themes)
- **Medium Puzzles**: Tracks 2, 5, 7 (moderate complexity, layered arrangements)
- **Hard Puzzles**: Tracks 3, 9 (complex arrangements, sophisticated development)
- **Ambient/Background**: Track 8 (atmospheric, evolving)
- **Completion**: Track 6 (triumphant, satisfying)

### Hybrid Approach Recommendation
Consider using elements from all three composers:
- **Williams**: Memorable themes, orchestral warmth, emotional clarity
- **Uematsu**: Catchy hooks, accessibility, emotional storytelling
- **Sakuraba**: Harmonic sophistication, technical depth, progressive structures

The final soundtrack should blend these approaches—memorable themes (Williams/Uematsu) with sophisticated harmony (Sakuraba), orchestral warmth (Williams) with electronic textures (all), emotional accessibility (Uematsu) with intellectual depth (Sakuraba).
