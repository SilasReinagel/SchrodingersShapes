## Session Summary

| Level | Grid | Seed | Moves | Result | Difficulty Rating |
|-------|------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | 2x2 | 1001 | 4 | ✅ Solved | 2/10 |
| 2 | 2x3 | 2002 | 6 | ✅ Solved | 2/10 |
| 3 | 3x3 | 3003 | 8 | ✅ Solved | 3/10 |

## Level 1 (Seed 1001)

### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Constraints
1. B2 ≠ Cat
2. B1 = Square
3. A1 = Circle
4. A1 ≠ Cat
5. B1 ≠ Cat
6. Row A: exactly 0 Cats
7. Row B: exactly 0 Circles
8. A1 ≠ Square
9. A2 = Square
10. A2 ≠ Cat

### Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ● | ■ |
  +---+---+
B | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
- Almost all cells had direct "= Shape" constraints
- Only B2 required deduction: couldn't be Circle (Row B rule), so chose Triangle
- Felt like a tutorial, not a puzzle

---

## Level 2 (Seed 2002)

### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
C | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Constraints
1. A2 ≠ Cat
2. B1 ≠ Cat
3. B2 = Triangle
4. C1 = Circle
5. C1 ≠ Cat
6. A1 = Square
7. B1 = Circle
8. Row C: exactly 0 Squares
9. A1 ≠ Cat
10. A2 = Triangle
11. C2 ≠ Cat
12. Col 2: exactly 0 Cats

### Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+
B | ● | ▲ |
  +---+---+
C | ● | ● |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
- Same pattern: direct assignments for 5/6 cells
- Only C2 required deduction (can't be Square per Row C rule)
- Bigger grid but not harder

---

## Level 3 (Seed 3003)

### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ●*| ? |
  +---+---+---+
B | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
```
*Note: A2 is locked (pre-filled Circle)*

### Constraints
1. B3 = Triangle
2. C1 ≠ Cat
3. A2 = Circle
4. B2 ≠ Cat
5. B1 = Triangle
6. A3 = Triangle
7. C3 ≠ Cat
8. A2 ≠ Cat
9. C2 ≠ Cat
10. A3 ≠ Cat
11. B2 = Triangle
12. B3 ≠ Cat
13. C1 = Triangle
14. Row C: exactly 0 Cats
15. C3 = Square
16. B1 ≠ Cat
17. Row C: exactly 0 Circles
18. Row B: exactly 0 Squares
19. C2 = Triangle
20. Col 1: exactly 0 Circles

### Solution
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ■ | ●*| ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
B | ▲ | ▲ | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
C | ▲ | ▲ | ■ |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Notes
- Locked cell (A2) was a nice new mechanic
- 8/9 cells still had direct "= Shape" constraints
- Only A1 required deduction: Col 1 has no Circles → Square or Triangle
- Row/Column count constraints existed but were mostly redundant

## Player Feedback

### Positives ✅
1. **Clear interface** - Grid display is easy to read
2. **Immediate feedback** - Checkmarks update in real-time
3. **Progress tracking** - "X/Y satisfied" counter is helpful
4. **Locked cells** - Nice visual indicator with `*`
5. **Symbol legend** - Good for quick reference

### Issues ⚠️

#### 1. Puzzles Too Easy (Critical)
Most constraints are direct assignments ("A1 = Square"). This removes the puzzle element entirely - I'm just following instructions rather than solving anything.

**Expected:** Multi-step deduction chains  
**Actual:** Single-step "read constraint, place shape"

#### 2. Redundant Constraints (Medium)
~50% of constraints are "X ≠ Cat" which just means "X needs a shape." These add clutter without adding puzzle depth.

#### 3. No Difficulty Progression (Critical)
Level 3 felt nearly identical to Level 1 in terms of mental effort required. Grid size increased but logical complexity didn't.

#### 4. Missing "Aha!" Moments (High)
Good logic puzzles have breakthrough moments. None of these puzzles required:
- Cross-referencing multiple constraints
- Process of elimination across rows/columns
- Working backwards from count constraints

## Recommendations

| Priority | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|------------|
| P0 | Over-constrained | Reduce direct "= Shape" constraints by 70% |
| P0 | No deduction needed | Require at least 2-3 multi-step deductions per puzzle |
| P1 | Redundant constraints | Hide or de-emphasize "≠ Cat" constraints |
| P1 | Flat difficulty | Each level should require noticeably more logic |
| P2 | Count constraints underused | More "exactly N" and "at least N" constraints |

## Ratings

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Interface is excellent |
| Challenge | ⭐☆☆☆☆ | Far too easy |
| Fun | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Satisfying to complete, not satisfying to solve |
| Replayability | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Would try harder levels |

**Overall:** 5/20

## Next Steps

Would like to try Level 4 and Level 5 to see if difficulty increases meaningfully. The core game mechanics are solid - just needs harder puzzle generation.
