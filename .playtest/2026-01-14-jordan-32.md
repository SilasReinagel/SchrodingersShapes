## Level 1 (Seed 3201)
### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Key Constraints
- Row A: exactly 0 Triangles, exactly 0 Squares
- Row B: exactly 0 Triangles, exactly 1 Circle
- Col 1: exactly 0 Squares

### Solution Process
The constraints heavily restrict Row A - no squares, no triangles means only circles allowed. Combined with Row B needing exactly 1 circle and Col 1 needing 0 squares, the solution becomes deterministic.

### Final Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ● | ● |
  +---+---+
B | ● | ■ |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
- Clean introduction level
- All constraints solvable through direct elimination
- No backtracking required

---

## Level 2 (Seed 3202)
### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
C | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Key Constraints
- Col 1: 0 triangles, 2 circles, 1 square
- Col 2: 0 circles, 2 triangles, 1 square
- Row A: 0 squares
- Row B: 0 triangles, 2 squares

### Solution Process
The column constraints define a clear partition - Col 1 gets all circles, Col 2 gets all triangles. Row constraints then determine placement within each row.

### Final Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ● | ▲ |
  +---+---+
B | ■ | ■ |
  +---+---+
C | ● | ▲ |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
- Satisfying column constraints naturally resolves row constraints
- Well-designed constraint interdependency

---

## Level 3 (Seed 3203)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ? |
  +---+---+---+
B | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Key Constraints
- **Col 1: exactly 1 Cat** ← First puzzle requiring unknown cells to remain!
- Col 2: exactly 2 Squares
- Col 3: exactly 2 Triangles, exactly 1 Circle
- Row A: 0 Circles, 0 Squares (must be Triangles or Cats)

### Solution Process
The "Col 1: exactly 1 Cat" constraint was the key insight. Since Row A must have no squares and no circles, A1 could only be Triangle or Cat. With Col 1 needing exactly 1 Cat and B1/C1 needing to be shapes for other constraints, A1 must remain Cat.

### Final Solution
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
B | ■ | ■ | ● |
  +---+---+---+
C | ▲ | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Notes
- First introduction of "superposition" mechanic (cells that must stay unknown)
- Required understanding that "Cat" counts are about *remaining* unknowns
- Elegant constraint design forces the Cat placement logically

---

## Level 4 (Seed 3204)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ●*|
  +---+---+---+
B | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
D | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Key Constraints
- Row A: exactly 1 Cat
- Col 1: exactly 1 Cat, exactly 2 Circles
- Col 2: exactly 3 Triangles
- Row B: 2 Squares, 0 Circles
- Row C: 2 Circles, 1 Triangle
- Row D: 2 Circles, 1 Triangle

### Solution Process
1. Row A needs 1 Cat, with A2=TRI and A3=CIR locked → A1=CAT
2. Col 1 needs 1 Cat (A1 satisfies) and 2 circles → B1, C1, D1 provide circles
3. Row B has 0 circles → B1=Square
4. Propagate through remaining constraints systematically

### Final Solution
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ●*|
  +---+---+---+
B | ■ | ▲ | ■ |
  +---+---+---+
C | ● | ▲ | ● |
  +---+---+---+
D | ● | ● | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Notes
- Multiple deduction chains required
- The Cat constraint interacts nicely with column distribution constraints
- Good difficulty progression from Level 3

---

## Level 5 (Seed 3205)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3   4  
  +---+---+---+---+
A | ? | ? | ■*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+---+
B | ●*| ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
D | ? | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

### Key Constraints (30 total!)
- Row A: 2 Squares (already locked), 0 Circles, 0 Triangles → A1, A2 = Cat
- Col 1: 1 Cat, 2 Circles, 1 Triangle
- Col 2: 1 Cat, 1 Triangle, 1 Square, 1 Circle
- Col 3: 3 Triangles, 1 Square (locked), 0 Circles
- Col 4: 1 Triangle, 1 Square (locked), 2 Circles
- Row C: 3 Triangles, 1 Circle
- Row D: 1 Triangle, 3 Circles

### Solution Process
With 30 constraints on a 16-cell grid, this required systematic constraint propagation:
1. Row A constraints force A1=CAT, A2=CAT immediately
2. Col 3 needs 3 triangles → B3, C3, D3 must all be triangles
3. Row D needs 3 circles + 1 triangle (D3) → D1, D2, D4 = circles
4. Continue propagating until grid is filled

### Final Solution
```
     1   2   3   4  
  +---+---+---+---+
A | ? | ? | ■*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+---+
B | ●*| ■ | ▲ | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+---+
C | ▲ | ▲ | ▲ | ● |
  +---+---+---+---+
D | ● | ● | ▲ | ● |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

### Notes
- Excellent complexity jump from Level 4
- Multiple cells must remain as Cat (superposition)
- Constraint satisfaction requires multi-step logical chains
- Very satisfying "aha" moment when deductions cascade

## Player Feedback
### Positives ✅
1. **Clean logical progression**: Each level builds on concepts from previous levels
2. **Deterministic solutions**: All puzzles solvable through pure deduction (no guessing)
3. **"Cat" mechanic is clever**: The superposition concept adds unique depth
4. **Constraint clarity**: No ambiguity in constraint interpretation
5. **Well-calibrated difficulty**: Each level feels appropriately harder
6. **Satisfying deduction chains**: Multiple constraints interact elegantly

### Issues ⚠️
1. **Constraint redundancy detection**: Some constraints could theoretically be derived from others, but having them explicit is actually helpful for verification
2. **No partial hints system**: For harder levels, a hint system might help casual players
3. **Level 5 complexity jump**: 30 constraints feels like a big step up; consider a 3.5/4.5 level

---

## Data Science Perspective
As someone who works with constraint satisfaction problems professionally, I found this puzzle extremely well-designed:

1. **Unique solutions**: Each puzzle has exactly one valid solution - this is crucial for fair puzzles
2. **Constraint density**: The ratio of constraints to cells is well-calibrated
3. **Logical completeness**: All solutions can be reached through forward chaining deduction
4. **No need for backtracking**: Unlike Sudoku where you might need to guess, these puzzles are fully deterministic

The "Cat" (unknown/superposition) mechanic is particularly interesting from a CSP perspective - it adds a dimension where the solver must determine not just *what* goes in each cell, but *whether* something should go there at all.

## Recommendations
| Priority | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Medium | Large difficulty jump L4→L5 | Add an intermediate 3x4 grid level with fewer constraints |
| Low | No hint system | Consider "reveal one deduction" hint for casual players |
| Low | Cat explanation | Tutorial could better explain that some cells should remain unknown |

---

## Ratings
| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Constraints are unambiguous and well-formatted |
| Challenge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Good progression, L5 is legitimately hard |
| Fun | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very satisfying deduction gameplay |
| Replayability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Seed system allows infinite puzzles |
| Innovation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Cat/superposition mechanic is unique |

**Overall:** 18/20

## Technical Notes
- All puzzles solved via CLI interface
- No bugs or errors encountered
- Constraint status feedback (✓/✗/○) was extremely helpful for verification
- Move counter accurately tracked all placements
