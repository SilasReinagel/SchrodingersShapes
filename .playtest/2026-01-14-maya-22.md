## Level 1 (Seed 2024)

### Initial State
```
     1   2  
A | ? | ? |
B | ? | ? |
```

### Constraints (10 total)
- Row B: 0 Cats, 0 Squares, 1 Triangle
- Row A: 1 Square, 1 Triangle
- Col 1: 0 Circles
- Col 2: 0 Squares, 1 Circle

### Solution
```
     1   2  
A | ■ | ▲ |
B | ▲ | ● |
```

### Notes
- Straightforward elimination logic
- All 10 constraints satisfied ✓
- Good intro puzzle - builds confidence!

---

## Level 2 (Seed 555)

### Initial State
```
     1   2  
A | ? | ? |
B | ? | ? |
C | ? | ? |
```

### Constraints (12 total)
- Row A: 2 Circles, 0 Squares
- Row B: 1 Triangle, 0 Circles
- Row C: 1 Square, 1 Triangle, 1 Circle
- Col 2: 0 Triangles, 2 Circles

### Solution
```
     1   2  
A | ● | ● |
B | ▲ | ■ |
C | ■ | ● |
```

### Notes
- Row A constraint (2 Circles) immediately reveals both cells
- Column constraints force B2 and D2 placements
- Satisfying "click" when everything falls into place

---

## Level 3 (Seed 777)

### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
A | ? | ▲*| ? |
B | ? | ? | ? |
C | ? | ? | ? |
```
*A2 locked as Triangle

### Key Constraints
- Row A: 1 Cat, 0 Circles, 0 Squares
- Col 1: 1 Cat, 1 Square, 1 Circle, 0 Triangles
- Row B: 2 Circles, 1 Square

### Solution
```
     1   2   3  
A | ? | ▲*| ▲ |   (A1 = Cat intentionally)
B | ■ | ● | ● |
C | ● | ■ | ▲ |
```

### Notes
- **FIRST PUZZLE WITH CAT CONSTRAINT** - A1 must remain unknown!
- Deduced A1 = Cat through elimination (Row A: 0 Circles, 0 Squares, and Col 1: 1 Cat)
- Solution is 100% logically correct
- **BUG:** Shows 13/20 satisfied instead of 20/20 - Cat-related constraints show as "in progress" (○) even though they're fulfilled

---

## Level 4 (Seed 999)

### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
A | ? | ▲*| ▲*|
B | ? | ? | ? |
C | ? | ? | ? |
D | ? | ? | ? |
```
*A2 and A3 locked as Triangles

### Key Constraints
- Row A: 2 Triangles (already satisfied!), 1 Cat
- Row C: 3 Triangles, 0 Squares, 0 Circles
- Col 1: 2 Triangles, 1 Square, 1 Cat, 0 Circles

### Solution
```
     1   2   3  
A | ? | ▲*| ▲*|   (A1 = Cat)
B | ● | ■ | ● |
C | ▲ | ▲ | ▲ |
D | ▲ | ■ | ▲ |
```

### Notes
- Row C being "all triangles" is a great hint to start with
- **SAME BUG:** 18/25 satisfied instead of 25/25
- Cat constraints not validating properly

---

## Level 5 (Seed 1234)

### Initial State
```
     1   2   3   4  
A | ? | ? | ▲*| ●*|
B | ▲*| ? | ? | ? |
C | ? | ? | ? | ? |
D | ? | ? | ? | ? |
```
*Three locked cells: A3=▲, A4=●, B1=▲

### Key Constraints (30 total!)
- Row A: 2 Cats, 1 Triangle, 1 Circle, 0 Squares
- Row B: 3 Squares, 1 Triangle
- Col 1: 2 Squares, 1 Cat, 1 Triangle
- Col 2: 2 Circles, 1 Square, 1 Cat

### Solution
```
     1   2   3   4  
A | ? | ? | ▲*| ●*|   (A1 and A2 = Cat)
B | ▲*| ■ | ■ | ■ |
C | ■ | ● | ▲ | ▲ |
D | ■ | ● | ▲ | ▲ |
```

### Notes
- Most complex puzzle with 30 constraints!
- "Row B: 3 Squares" + B1=▲ locked → B2, B3, B4 are all Squares
- **TWO Cat cells** (A1 and A2) required
- **SAME BUG:** 18/30 satisfied instead of 30/30
- All Cat-related constraints showing as "in progress"

## Player Feedback

### Positives ✅

1. **Elimination logic feels satisfying** - When you figure out a cell can only be one thing, it's a nice "aha!" moment
2. **Constraint variety is good** - Row counts, column counts, and cell exclusions create interesting interactions
3. **Difficulty scales well** - Each level genuinely felt harder than the last
4. **Locked cells are helpful** - They give you a starting point to anchor your deductions
5. **CLI is clean and readable** - Grid visualization and constraint list are easy to parse

### Issues ⚠️

1. **CRITICAL BUG: Cat constraints don't validate**
   - When a puzzle requires intentionally leaving cells as "Cat" (unknown), those constraints never show as ✓ satisfied
   - This means puzzles with Cat requirements can never show 🎉 PUZZLE SOLVED!
   - Affects Levels 3, 4, and 5
   
2. **Constraint redundancy**
   - Some constraints feel redundant (e.g., "Row B: 0 Cats" + "Col 1: 0 Cats" when all cells need shapes anyway)
   - Could confuse players or make constraint list feel bloated

3. **"0 Cats" constraints are confusing**
   - What does "0 Cats" mean? At first I thought it meant "no cat shapes allowed"
   - Actually means "no cells can be left unknown"
   - Terminology is unclear

## Recommendations

| Priority | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 🔴 Critical | Cat constraints don't validate | Fix constraint checker to recognize Cat as a valid "shape" state, not just "undetermined" |
| 🟡 Medium | "Cat" terminology | Consider renaming to "Unknown" or "?" in constraint text |
| 🟡 Medium | Constraint redundancy | Consider auto-hiding trivially implied constraints |
| 🟢 Low | No explicit "commit Cat" action | Maybe add a way to explicitly mark a cell as "intentionally unknown" |

---

## Ratings

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Constraints are clear once you understand the Cat terminology |
| Challenge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Good difficulty curve, Level 5 was brain-burny! |
| Fun | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Satisfying deduction, but bug frustration lowers enjoyment |
| Replayability | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Seeded puzzles are great, would play more once bug is fixed |

**Overall:** 14/20

## Bug Details for Developers

### Cat Constraint Validation Bug

**Reproduction:**
1. Start Level 3, Seed 777
2. Solve puzzle leaving A1 as Cat (the only valid solution)
3. Observe: Constraint "Col 1: exactly 1 Cat" shows ○ (in progress), not ✓

**Expected:** When a cell is in Cat state and the constraint requires exactly N Cats, it should count toward that constraint.

**Actual:** Cat cells are treated as "undetermined" rather than a valid committed state.

**Affected Constraints:**
- `exactly N Cats` (where N > 0)
- `exactly 0 Circles/Squares/Triangles` (can't be validated if Cat cells exist)
