## Level 1 (Seed 1601)
### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Constraints (10 total)
- Row A: exactly 0 Cats, 0 Squares
- Row B: exactly 0 Cats, 0 Circles, 1 Triangle, 1 Square
- Col 1: exactly 0 Circles, 0 Cats
- Col 2: exactly 0 Squares, 0 Cats

### Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ▲ | ● |
  +---+---+
B | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
Dead easy to start with. Good warmup. Every constraint basically told you exactly what to do - no guessing needed. Perfect for learning the game.

---

## Level 2 (Seed 1602)
### Initial State
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
B | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
C | ? | ? |
  +---+---+
```

### Constraints (12 total)
Key constraints:
- Row A: 0 Squares, 1 Triangle
- Row B: 0 Squares, 2 Triangles  
- Row C: 0 Triangles, 1 Circle
- Col 2: 0 Squares, 2 Circles

### Solution
```
     1   2  
  +---+---+
A | ▲ | ● |
  +---+---+
B | ▲ | ▲ |
  +---+---+
C | ■ | ● |
  +---+---+
```

### Notes
Bit more to think about here with the 2x3 grid. The row constraints made it pretty straightforward though - Row B being "all triangles" was the key unlock.

---

## Level 3 (Seed 1603)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ? |
  +---+---+---+
B | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Constraints (20 total)
Key constraints:
- Col 1: 2 Squares, 0 Triangles, 0 Circles, **1 Cat**
- Col 2: 2 Triangles, 0 Circles, 0 Cats
- Row A: **1 Cat**, 0 Squares

### Solution
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ● |
  +---+---+---+
B | ■ | ▲ | ■ |
  +---+---+---+
C | ■ | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Notes
This is where it got properly interesting! The "Cat" constraints blew my mind a bit - you have to intentionally leave a cell empty? That's well clever. Took me a minute to wrap my head around it but once it clicked, it made perfect sense. A1 stays as a Cat because both Row A and Col 1 specifically need exactly 1 Cat.

---

## Level 4 (Seed 1604)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+
B | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
D | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Constraints (25 total)
Key constraints:
- Col 1: 2 Triangles, 1 Square, 0 Circles, **1 Cat**
- Col 2: 1 Triangle, 1 Square, 2 Circles, 0 Cats
- Col 3: 1 Triangle, 2 Squares, 1 Circle, 0 Cats
- Row A: 1 Triangle, 1 Square, 0 Circles (leaves A1 as Cat)

### Solution
```
     1   2   3  
  +---+---+---+
A | ? | ▲*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+
B | ▲ | ■ | ● |
  +---+---+---+
C | ■ | ● | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+
D | ▲ | ● | ■ |
  +---+---+---+
```

### Notes
25 constraints felt like a lot but they all worked together nicely. The deduction chain was longer - had to think about how constraints on different rows/columns interacted. Really satisfying when it all comes together.

---

## Level 5 (Seed 1605)
### Initial State
```
     1   2   3   4  
  +---+---+---+---+
A | ? | ? | ▲*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+---+
B | ■*| ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
C | ? | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
D | ? | ? | ? | ? |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

### Constraints (30 total)
Key constraints:
- Row A: **2 Cats**, 1 Triangle, 1 Square, 0 Circles
- Row D: **4 Circles**, 0 Squares, 0 Triangles, 0 Cats
- Col 2: 2 Triangles, **1 Cat**, 1 Circle, 0 Squares

### Solution
```
     1   2   3   4  
  +---+---+---+---+
A | ? | ? | ▲*| ■*|
  +---+---+---+---+
B | ■*| ▲ | ■ | ■ |
  +---+---+---+---+
C | ▲ | ▲ | ■ | ▲ |
  +---+---+---+---+
D | ● | ● | ● | ● |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

### Notes
Absolute banger of a puzzle! Row D being all circles and Row A having 2 Cats were the big "aha" moments. Loved how the constraints basically forced unique solutions through elimination. The locked cells (3 of them!) gave good anchor points to work from.

## Player Feedback

### Positives ✅
1. **The Cat mechanic is genius** - Intentionally leaving cells empty adds a whole new dimension. It's like Schrödinger's cat innit - the shape exists and doesn't exist until you observe it!
2. **Constraints are clear and unambiguous** - Never felt like I was guessing. Pure logic all the way.
3. **Good difficulty curve** - Level 1 was a warmup, Level 5 was properly hard. Felt earned.
4. **Satisfying "aha" moments** - When multiple constraints click together and you suddenly know what goes where.
5. **Locked cells help** - Having some cells pre-filled gives you starting points without making it too easy.

### Issues ⚠️
1. **Constraint overload** - 30 constraints in Level 5 was a lot to keep track of. Might be overwhelming for some players.
2. **No hints system** - If you're stuck, you're stuck. Would be nice to have optional hints.
3. **"Exactly 0 Cats" constraints are redundant** - If you say "Row B: 0 Cats", that just means "fill all cells in Row B". Could be implied.

---

## Recommendations
| Priority | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Medium | Constraint overload | Group similar constraints visually (all Row constraints together, etc.) |
| Low | Redundant "0 Cats" constraints | Consider removing "exactly 0 Cats" and making it implied that empty cells = Cats |
| Low | No hints | Add optional hint system for players who get stuck |
| Low | Visual feedback | Highlight which constraints a placement affects in real-time |

## Ratings
| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Constraints are crystal clear |
| Challenge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Good progression, Level 5 is properly hard |
| Fun | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Love the satisfaction of solving these |
| Replayability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Different seeds = different puzzles, good variety |

**Overall: 18/20**

## Additional Comments

*"Honestly mate, this is proper good. Reminds me of Sudoku but with more variety because you've got different shapes and the Cat thing. The name 'Schrödinger's Shapes' is brilliant too - the Cat mechanic actually makes sense with the quantum reference. Would definitely play more of these on the bus to school. Maybe add a timer for speedrunning? I'd compete with my mates on who can solve Level 5 fastest."*

## Technical Notes
- CLI interface worked flawlessly
- All puzzles solvable through pure logical deduction
- No bugs or unexpected behavior encountered
- Constraint system is mathematically sound - no contradictions found
