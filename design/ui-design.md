Below is a high-level **UI mockup** concept for **Schrödinger’s Shapes**, focusing on a **clean, minimalist design** and elements that encourage **viral sharing**. The goal is to provide an interface that is easy to learn, visually appealing, and highly shareable.

└───────────────────────────────────┘

       [Footer / Status Bar / Moves / Undo Button]
```

1. **Top Nav Bar**  
   - **Title/Logo**: A simple text or small icon reading “Schrödinger’s Shapes.”  
   - **Timer**: Displays elapsed time or a move counter to encourage friendly competition (“00:35” or “Moves: 5”).  
   - **Share Button**: One-click/tap social sharing (Twitter, Facebook, etc.). This could auto-generate a small thumbnail of the puzzle grid, or a witty phrase (“I collapsed the shapes in 32 seconds!”).

2. **Central Puzzle Grid**  
   - This is the main focus, using most of the screen’s real estate (especially on desktop; mobile can adapt to a vertically stacked layout).  
   - **Each cell**:  
     - **Superposition** shown as a simple “?” icon, or a subtle swirling gradient/outline to denote it hasn’t been collapsed.  
     - When collapsed, the cell shows a **shape** (square, circle, triangle) in a crisp, monochrome or pastel color.  
     - **Hover/click** (desktop) or **tap/hold** (mobile) triggers a small overlay or radial menu to choose which shape you want to collapse to (if allowed).

3. **Right-Side Constraints Panel**  
   - Lists or icons that show each puzzle’s constraints. For example:  
     - “Row 1: Exactly 2 squares”  
     - “Column 2: No circles”  
     - “Entire Grid: Exactly 3 superpositions remain at end”  
   - Constraints highlight (e.g., turn green) when satisfied, or remain neutral/red if not yet met.  
   - This panel can collapse to a minimal view to save space on smaller screens.

4. **Footer / Status Bar**  
   - Could display additional puzzle info or controls:  
     - **Move Counter**: “Moves: 5/20” or “Collapses: 7.”  
     - **Undo Button**: Allows players to revert a step.  
     - **Hint Button** (optional): In puzzle games that want to remain minimalist, you might hide or limit hints behind a small menu.

## **2. Aesthetics**

- **Color Palette**:  
  - Background: Off-white or very light gray.  
  - Grid Lines: Thin, medium-gray or black lines for a crisp, clean look.  
  - Shapes: Minimal color usage—maybe black outlines with subtle pastel fills (e.g., pastel pink square, pastel blue circle, pastel yellow triangle).  
  - Superposition (“?”) cells: Slightly tinted background or a small swirling animation to distinguish them from collapsed shapes.

- **Typography**:  
  - Use a simple sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto, or similar) for a modern minimalist feel.  
  - Keep text short and direct, focusing on puzzle instructions and constraints.

## **3. Interactions & Feedback**

1. **Cell Interaction**  
   - **Hover (desktop)**: Cell border highlights; a small tooltip indicates “Click to collapse.”  
   - **Click/Tap**: Opens a tiny pop-up or radial menu with shape icons (Square, Circle, Triangle), plus a “?” icon to revert to superposition if the puzzle rules allow toggling back.  
   - **Real-Time Constraint Feedback**: Each time a cell collapses, constraints update in real time. Satisfied constraints could be highlighted in green. Unsatisfied or violated ones might flash or turn red briefly.

2. **Animations**  
   - **Collapse Animation**: A quick morph from “?” to the chosen shape. Subtle, fast enough not to disrupt flow.  
   - **Constraint Highlight**: If a rule becomes satisfied, it smoothly lights up in green for a second.

3. **Social Sharing Flow**  
   - When a puzzle is solved, a small **“Success / You Solved It!”** overlay appears with:  
     - **Time / Moves**: “You finished in 1:12 with 8 moves.”  
     - **Share / Tweet** button: Auto-copies or auto-generates a short message:  
       > “I solved ‘Schrödinger’s Shapes’ (Puzzle #15) in 1:12. Can you do better? [Short Link]”  
     - **Replay / Next Puzzle** button for continuous engagement.

## **4. Mobile Considerations**

- **Responsive Layout**:  
  - On smaller screens, move the **Constraints Panel** below the grid or into a toggleable drawer.  
  - Top Nav Bar can compress to show only a hamburger menu icon, puzzle title, and a share icon.  
- **Gestures**:  
  - Tap a cell to cycle shapes (if you want a simpler one-touch flow).  
  - Long-press or double-tap for advanced options (hint, revert to “?”).

## **5. Viral Hooks**

1. **Daily Challenge or Puzzle #**  
   - A daily “featured puzzle” so players can compare times with friends (“Today’s #36: I solved it in 00:58!”).  
   - Each puzzle has a **unique code** or URL so it’s easy to share or replay the exact puzzle.

2. **Leaderboard / Ranking**  
   - (Optional) Show a weekly or monthly leaderboard with top times or minimal moves.  
   - Encourage competition and social bragging rights.

3. **One-Click Social Share**  
   - Make sure the share button is always visible—**frictionless** for those “I must brag about finishing!” moments.  
   - Generate a shareable puzzle screenshot or highlight shapes (maybe an auto-generated GIF that morphs from “?” to final configuration, if performance allows).

4. **Minimal Tutorial**  
   - A short, interactive tutorial puzzle (1–2 steps) that’s instantly shareable—low barrier to entry.  
   - People can quickly learn the basics, then challenge friends to do the same tutorial puzzle faster.

---

## **Summary**

- A **clean, central grid** flanked by a concise **constraints panel** keeps the puzzle logic front and center.  
- **Real-time feedback**, **simple animations**, and a **top nav bar** with a visible **share button** all contribute to an engaging experience that’s easy to share virally.  
- **Responsive design** and quick puzzle completions encourage repeated plays and friendly competition.

With this approach, **Schrödinger’s Shapes** feels intuitive, looks sleek, and invites the social, viral energy you’re aiming for.
