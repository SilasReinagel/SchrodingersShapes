# Schr√∂dinger's Shapes - Game Design Document

## Overview
A minimalist puzzle game where players manipulate quantum shapes in cat states to solve grid-based challenges.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Puzzle game enthusiasts ages 12+
- Secondary: Students learning basic quantum concepts
- Casual mobile gamers who enjoy brain teasers

## Core Game Loop
1. Player examines puzzle grid and constraints
2. Strategically resolves cat cells into specific shapes
3. Validates solution against level requirements
4. Progresses to next puzzle upon success
5. Returns daily for new puzzle challenges

## Level Design

### Progression
1. Tutorial Levels (2x2 grid)
   - Introduce basic shapes and cat states
   - Simple row/column constraints
   - Guided solutions

2. Early Game (3x3 grid) 
   - Basic shape combinations
   - Single constraint types
   - Limited cat states

3. Mid Game (3x3 and 4x4)
   - Multiple constraint types
   - Shape relationships
   - Strategic cat state management

4. Late Game (4x4 and larger)
   - Complex multi-constraint puzzles
   - Time pressure mechanics
   - Limited moves/resolutions

5. Daily Puzzles
   - New puzzle released each day
   - Progressive difficulty throughout week
   - Special weekend challenges
   - Leaderboards and completion streaks

### Level Components
- Grid size (2x2 to 5x5)
- Available shapes (Square, Circle, Triangle)
- Initial cat states
- Row/column/global constraints
- Move limits (optional)
- Time limits (optional)

## Visual Style
- Clean, geometric shapes
- High contrast colors
- Subtle animations for state changes
- Minimalist UI elements
- Quantum-inspired particle effects

## Audio Design
- Soft ambient background music
- Satisfying "crystallize" sounds for resolving states
- Success/failure sound effects
- UI interaction sounds

## Technical Requirements
- React TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Vite for build tooling
- Vitest for testing

## Monetization (Optional)
- Free to play with ads
- Premium version removes ads
- Hint system with limited free hints
- Additional puzzle packs as IAP

## Success Metrics
- Player retention (DAU/MAU)
- Daily puzzle completion rate
- Completion streaks
- Average session length
- Puzzle completion rate
- Tutorial completion rate
- Optional IAP conversion rate

## Future Expansion
- Community puzzle creator
- Multiplayer challenges
- Additional shape types
- Special mechanics (quantum entanglement)
- Educational mode with quantum physics concepts
