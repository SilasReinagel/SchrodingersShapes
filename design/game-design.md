Below is a more in-depth explanation of **Schrödinger’s Shapes** mechanics, followed by two sample puzzles (with suggested solutions) you can use to illustrate how the game might work.

## **Core Mechanics**

1. **Grid & Shapes**  
   - The puzzle is played on a small grid (e.g., 2×2, 3×3, 4×4).  
   - Each cell can contain a shape (e.g., **square**, **circle**, or **triangle**), or it can exist in a **cat** state.  
   - A “cat” shape is essentially *undecided* and can collapse into any of the defined shapes (or potentially “no shape,” if you allow empty cells) when the player decides.

2. **Collapsing Cat**  
   - Players can click/tap on a cat cell to choose which shape it collapses into.  
   - Collapsing is usually irreversible, forcing the player to plan carefully. (You could allow an “undo” button for user-friendliness.)

3. **Constraints**  
   - Each puzzle level has a set of logical or numerical constraints describing how many shapes (and which types) must appear in certain rows, columns, or the entire grid. For example:  
     - “Row 1 must contain exactly 2 circles.”  
     - “At least 1 triangle must be in Column 3.”  
     - “Exactly 4 squares in the entire grid.”  
     - Some puzzles might even require certain cells to *remain* in a cat state (never collapsed).

4. **Winning Condition**  
   - The puzzle is solved when all constraints are satisfied. This typically means collapsing cats in such a way that each row, column, or region meets its shape requirements.

5. **Minimalist Aesthetic & Interaction**  
   - Keep visuals simple: each cell has one symbol (square, circle, triangle) or a “?” to represent a cat state.  
   - A single-click or tap cycles through shapes (if you allow toggling) or a small pop-up lets you pick the shape.

### Puzzle Layout

We have a 2×2 grid:
