Below is a more in-depth explanation of **Schrödinger's Shapes** mechanics, followed by two sample puzzles (with suggested solutions) you can use to illustrate how the game might work.

## **Core Mechanics**

1. **Grid & Shapes**  
   - The puzzle is played on a small grid (e.g., 2×2, 3×3, 4×4).  
   - Each cell can contain a shape (e.g., **square**, **circle**, or **triangle**), or it can exist in a **cat** state.  
   - A "cat" shape represents quantum superposition - it simultaneously counts as ALL possible shapes (square, circle, and triangle) as well as a cat state itself. This makes it extremely powerful for satisfying multiple constraints at once.

2. **Collapsing Cat**  
   - Players can click/tap on a cat cell to choose which shape it collapses into.  
   - Collapsing is usually irreversible, forcing the player to plan carefully. (You could allow an "undo" button for user-friendliness.)
   - Strategic use of cat states is crucial, as they can satisfy multiple shape requirements simultaneously.

3. **Constraints**  
   - Each puzzle level has a set of logical or numerical constraints describing how many shapes (and which types) must appear in certain rows, columns, or the entire grid. For example:  
     - "Row 1 must contain exactly 2 circles." (Cat shapes in Row 1 count towards this total)
     - "At least 1 triangle must be in Column 3." (A cat shape in Column 3 satisfies this)
     - "Exactly 4 squares in the entire grid." (Cat shapes count towards this total)
     - Some puzzles might even require certain cells to *remain* in a cat state (never collapsed).

4. **Winning Condition**  
   - The puzzle is solved when all constraints are satisfied, keeping in mind that cat shapes count as all shape types simultaneously.
   - This means a single cat shape can help satisfy multiple different shape constraints at once!

5. **Minimalist Aesthetic & Interaction**  
   - Keep visuals simple: each cell has one symbol (square, circle, triangle) or a "?" to represent a cat state.  
   - A single-click or tap cycles through shapes (if you allow toggling) or a small pop-up lets you pick the shape.

## **Designing Clever Constraints**

The beauty of Schrödinger's Shapes lies in creating puzzles that make players feel clever without overwhelming them. Here are some constraint ideas that leverage the quantum ambiguity while remaining approachable:

### 1. **Complementary Constraints**
- Pair constraints that seem contradictory but can be solved with strategic cat placement:
  - "Row 1 needs exactly 2 circles" + "Row 1 needs exactly 2 squares"
  - This is only possible with cat states counting as both shapes simultaneously!

### 2. **Overlapping Requirements**
- Create constraints that intersect in interesting ways:
  - "Column 1 must have exactly 1 triangle" + "Row 2 must have exactly 1 triangle"
  - The player realizes the cat must go at their intersection point

### 3. **Conservation Puzzles**
- Constraints that force players to be economical with their cats:
  - "The grid must contain exactly 3 cats" + various shape requirements
  - Players must determine the optimal placement of limited cat states

### 4. **Negative Space Puzzles**
- Define what cannot be in certain areas:
  - "Row 1 cannot contain any triangles"
  - "Column 2 must have at most 1 square"
  - These constraints guide players by elimination

### 5. **Quantum Majority Rules**
- Create constraints about relative quantities:
  - "There must be more circles than squares in the grid"
  - "Column 3 must have the same number of triangles as Column 1"

### 6. **Adjacency Rules**
- Add spatial relationships for more variety:
  - "No two circles can be adjacent"
  - "Every triangle must be adjacent to at least one square"
  - Cat states make these especially interesting!

### 7. **Forced Observation**
- Some cells start locked as specific shapes
- Some cat cells must remain as cats (cannot be collapsed)
- This creates a nice metaphor for quantum observation

### 8. **Progression of Difficulty**
- Early puzzles: Simple counting constraints with obvious cat placements
- Mid-level: Multiple overlapping constraints requiring some planning
- Advanced: Constraints that interact in subtle ways, requiring players to think several moves ahead

The magic happens when players have their "aha!" moment - realizing that the cat state's ambiguity is precisely what makes an apparently impossible set of constraints solvable. This creates satisfaction without frustration, as the solution feels clever rather than obscure.
